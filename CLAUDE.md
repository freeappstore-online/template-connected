## Architecture
This is a CONNECTED app — the free and pro versions share the same Firebase backend.
- Free version: limited features (browse, basic interactions)
- Pro version: full features (create, collaborate, AI, cloud sync)
- Feature gating: Firestore security rules enforce access based on user plan (free/pro)
- Firebase config: set via VITE_FIREBASE_* env vars (or .env.production file)
